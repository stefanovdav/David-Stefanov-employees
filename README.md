- That should open a window on your browser and if the spring server is also working you can use the application
- Important: if the file is not supported, not structured the way the application wants and the Import is exected the browser page will become white and you will need to reload it. (There is an example .csv file in the backend resources that can be used as an example for what the app wants)
